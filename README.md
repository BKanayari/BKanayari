# 🥾Bernardus Kanayari, Hi There Fellow Coders✋🏻

***'Code Venture (iOS Developer/Content Creator/Adventurer)'***

I'm an iOS Developer with one year of experience and I have developed iOS App projects together with a team and personally. And I like what I do now because it is in line with my life goal, namely to become a lifelong learner, and I always hone my problem solving skills with the challenges that arise in my daily life as an iOS Developer. This was all driven by my high curiosity. With the skills I now have, I think I still have a lot to develop, but I am also happy because I can have an impact on those around me with the skills I have. Don't hesitate to contact me via email bernarduskanayari.public@gmail.com, I am waiting for an invitation to collaborate or discuss about iOS Development
